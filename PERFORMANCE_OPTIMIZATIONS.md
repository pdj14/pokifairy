# Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented for the PokiFairy AI integration.

## Overview

Task 14 (성능 최적화) has been completed with four major optimization areas:
1. AI Model Lazy Loading
2. Memory Management
3. UI Performance Optimization
4. Battery Optimization

---

## 14.1 AI Model Lazy Loading

### Implementation

**Problem**: Loading AI models at app startup significantly increases launch time and uses memory even when AI features aren't being used.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading that defers AI model initialization until the first chat message is sent.

### Key Changes

1. **Modified `startup_service.dart`**:
   - Removed AI service initialization from app startup
   - Only loads model path and validates model existence
   - AI service initialization is deferred

2. **Added `lazyAiInitializationProvider` in `ai_providers.dart`**:
   - New provider that initializes AI only when needed
   - Tracks loading progress with `AiLoadingProgress` state
   - Shows progress: 0.1 (searching) → 0.3 (loading) → 0.9 (finalizing) → 1.0 (complete)

3. **Updated `ChatController.sendMessage()`**:
   - Checks if AI service is initialized before sending message
   - Triggers lazy initialization on first message
   - Shows loading message to user during initialization

4. **Created `AiLoadingIndicator` widget**:
   - Displays loading progress bar with percentage
   - Shows current loading stage message
   - Styled to match app theme

### Benefits

- **Faster app startup**: AI model loading no longer blocks app launch
- **Reduced memory usage**: Model only loaded when needed
- **Better UX**: Clear progress indication during first-time loading
- **Resource efficiency**: Users who don't use AI features don't pay the cost

## 14.2 Memory Management

### Implementation

**Problem**: AI models consume significant memory, and long chat histories can accumulate, leading to memory pressure.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic memory management with message limits and model unloading capabilities.

### Key Changes

1. **ChatController Memory Limits**:
   - `maxMessages = 100`: Hard limit on chat history
   - `_trimHistory()`: Automatically removes old messages when limit exceeded
   - Called after each AI response to maintain limit

2. **AI Service Memory Management**:
   - Added `unloadModel()` method to release model from memory
   - Added `getMemoryStatus()` to check current memory state
   - Model path preserved for quick reload

3. **Memory Pressure Handling**:
   - Added `didHaveMemoryPressure()` in `main.dart`
   - Automatically unloads AI model when system reports memory pressure
   - Shows warning message to user
   - Model reloads automatically on next message

4. **ChatController Low Memory Handler**:
   - `handleLowMemory()` method unloads AI model
   - Adds system warning message to chat
   - Preserves chat history

### Benefits

- **Prevents OOM crashes**: Automatic memory management prevents out-of-memory errors
- **Graceful degradation**: App continues functioning even under memory pressure
- **User awareness**: Clear messaging when memory-saving actions occur
- **Quick recovery**: Model reloads seamlessly when needed

## 14.3 UI Performance Optimization

### Implementation

**Problem**: Rendering large chat histories and frequent UI updates can cause frame drops and stuttering.

**Solution**: Implemented multiple UI optimization techniques to ensure smooth 60fps performance.

### Key Changes

1. **ListView.builder Usage**:
   - Already using `ListView.builder` for efficient list rendering
   - Only renders visible items, not entire chat history
   - Reduces widget tree size and memory usage

2. **Input Debouncing**:
   - `ChatInput` widget already implements 300ms debouncing
   - Prevents excessive setState calls during typing
   - Updates send button state only after typing pauses

3. **Widget Keys**:
   - Added `ValueKey(message.id)` to each `MessageBubble`
   - Added `ValueKey('typing_indicator')` to typing indicator
   - Helps Flutter efficiently update and reorder widgets

4. **RepaintBoundary**:
   - Wrapped each `MessageBubble` in `RepaintBoundary`
   - Isolates message repaints from rest of UI
   - Prevents unnecessary repaints of unchanged messages

5. **Const Constructors**:
   - All widgets use `const` constructors where possible
   - `MessageBubble`, `TypingIndicator`, `ChatInput` all use const
   - Reduces widget rebuilds and memory allocations

6. **AnimatedBuilder Optimization**:
   - `TypingIndicator` uses `AnimatedBuilder` for efficient animations
   - Only rebuilds animated portion, not entire widget
   - Smooth 60fps animation with minimal overhead

### Benefits

- **Smooth scrolling**: Large chat histories scroll without frame drops
- **Responsive input**: No lag when typing messages
- **Efficient updates**: Only changed messages repaint
- **Lower CPU usage**: Fewer widget rebuilds and repaints
- **Better battery life**: Reduced CPU usage extends battery

## 14.4 Battery Optimization

### Implementation

**Problem**: AI inference is CPU-intensive and can drain battery quickly, especially when running in background.

**Solution**: Implemented battery-aware AI operations that pause in background and use optimized settings.

### Key Changes

1. **Background State Management**:
   - Added `_isBackgrounded` flag to `AIService`
   - Added `setBackgroundState()` method
   - AI generation immediately stops when app goes to background

2. **Lifecycle Integration**:
   - `main.dart` calls `setBackgroundState(true)` on `AppLifecycleState.paused`
   - Calls `setBackgroundState(false)` on `AppLifecycleState.resumed`
   - Ensures AI operations only run when app is active

3. **Battery Optimization Mode**:
   - Added `_batteryOptimizationEnabled` flag (default: true)
   - Reduces `maxTokens` from 1024 to 512 when enabled
   - Shorter responses = less CPU time = better battery life

4. **Stream Cancellation**:
   - `generateResponseStream()` checks `_isBackgrounded` in loop
   - Immediately breaks stream if app goes to background
   - Prevents wasted CPU cycles on invisible responses

5. **Battery Optimization Providers**:
   - `batteryOptimizationProvider`: State management for battery mode
   - `toggleBatteryOptimizationProvider`: Action to enable/disable
   - Can be exposed in settings UI for user control

### Benefits

- **Extended battery life**: AI only runs when app is visible
- **No background drain**: Zero AI CPU usage when app is paused
- **Optimized inference**: Shorter responses use less power
- **User control**: Can toggle optimization based on needs
- **Graceful handling**: Ongoing generation stops cleanly on background

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Token Limits**:
   - Adjust maxTokens based on battery level
   - Use longer responses when charging

2. **Intelligent Caching**:
   - Cache common responses
   - Reduce inference for repeated questions

3. **Progressive Loading**:
   - Load smaller model first for quick responses
   - Upgrade to larger model for complex queries

4. **Background Preloading**:
   - Optionally preload model during idle time
   - Only when device is charging and on WiFi

## Configuration

### Battery Optimization Toggle

Users can control battery optimization through providers:

```dart
// Enable battery optimization
ref.read(toggleBatteryOptimizationProvider)(true);

// Disable for longer, more detailed responses
ref.read(toggleBatteryOptimizationProvider)(false);

// Check current state
final isOptimized = ref.watch(batteryOptimizationProvider);
```

### Memory Limits

Adjust in `ChatController`:

```dart
static const int maxMessages = 100; // Change as needed
```

### Loading Progress

Customize in `lazyAiInitializationProvider`:

```dart
// Adjust progress stages and delays
ref.read(aiLoadingProgressProvider.notifier).state = 
    const AiLoadingProgress.loading(0.5, 'Custom message...');
```
