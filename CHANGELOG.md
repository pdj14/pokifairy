### 🎯 Known Issues
- Large models (>4GB) may cause memory pressure on low-end devices
  - Workaround: Use smaller quantized models (Q4 or Q2)
- First AI response may be slower due to model warm-up
  - Expected behavior: Subsequent responses will be faster
- Android 11+ requires manual "All files access" permission
  - See [AI Model Setup Guide](docs/AI_MODEL_SETUP.md) for instructions

### 🚀 Performance Metrics
