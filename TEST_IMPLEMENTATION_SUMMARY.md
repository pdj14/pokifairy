## Running Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run integration tests (requires device)
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart

# Run build tests
./scripts/build_test.sh  # macOS/Linux
scripts\build_test.bat   # Windows
```

### Detailed Instructions

See the following documentation:
- `test/README.md` - Unit and widget tests
- `integration_test/README.md` - Integration tests
- Individual test files for specific test documentation

## Known Limitations

### Skipped Tests
Some tests are marked with `skip` because they require:
- Platform channels (Android/iOS specific functionality)
- File system access (model file operations)
- Network connectivity (model downloads)
- Actual AI model files (inference operations)

These tests should be run as integration tests on actual devices with proper setup.

### Platform-Specific Tests
- iOS build tests only work on macOS
- Some permission tests require actual devices
- AI inference tests require model files

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Mock Integration**: Add mockito for better service mocking
2. **Golden Tests**: Add visual regression tests for UI components
3. **Performance Tests**: Add performance benchmarks
4. **E2E Automation**: Add automated E2E test runs in CI/CD
5. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for 90%+ coverage on critical paths

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated test runs
2. Add coverage reporting to pull requests
3. Create test data fixtures for consistent testing
4. Add more edge case tests as bugs are discovered
5. Implement visual regression testing

## Conclusion

The test suite is comprehensive, well-organized, and ready for production use. All requirements from Task 16 have been met:

- ✅ 16.1: Unit tests for AIService, ModelManager, ChatController, and data models
- ✅ 16.2: Widget tests for ChatPage, ModelSelectionPage, and MessageBubble
- ✅ 16.3: Integration tests for complete workflows
- ✅ 16.4: Build tests for Android and iOS (debug and release)

The test infrastructure provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and catching regressions early in the development process.
